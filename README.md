_A few quick notes_:  
 While it won't be listed in requirements, checking for errors was a part of every assignment.  
 Links to the zip files will be a part of the header (so below, Assignment 1 leads to the download link for the zip file)

## [Assignment 1](Lent.zip)
 ### Requirements:  
* Create a composition using shapes that could be interpreted to be either an 'outerspace' or 'cityscape' scene.  
* Create a canvas that is 128 pixels wide by 128 high (at a minimum).  
* Create a gray background for the canvas with a grayscale color value.  
* For all shapes in your composition, use only grayscale values for the stroke and fill colors.  
* For shapes in your composition, create shapes from the four primitive types listed below, for example, create a point and a rectangle:
  * _Point_
  * _Line_
  * _Ellipse_
  * _Rectangle_  
* Create, at a minimum, one primitive shape with either no stroke or no fill.  
* Change the style of the stroke on one shape, at a minimum, to round, bevel, or join.
  * _Use strokeJoin() or strokeCap()_
 
 This was our first assignment we had done for the class, and it was fairly simple.  
 For this, I had decided to go with a city skyline, like a foggy day in a big city.  
 Now I have knowledge prior to this class (Mostly due to having to retake it thanks to a bad semester for me), so I know I could've added color to it, but I decided to keep it simple and stick to the required grayscale colors.  
 To keep everything from blending together, I tried to use various different shades of gray for each building (This also helped give a sense of depth to the image), and all of the lights were pure white to help them stand out.  
 I primarily ended up using the line & rectangle tool to make most of the image, but I made sure to add a point or ellipse in part of the image. The line tool was mostly for the smaller details on the roofs of the buildings.  
 The only issue I had came across was the fact that I forgot to incorporate the last point of the requirements. I must've skimmed the assignment and missed that point.
 And here's what the code in the zip file produces (The final product)!

## [Assignment 5](Lent%205.zip)
 ### Requirements:  
* Design a composition that is within the theme of either Television or a Desktop Computer.  
* Create a canvas that is 400 pixels wide by 400 high (at a minimum).  
* Add a minimum of two buttons, one, a rectangle shape, and the other, a ellipse. Each button should use either the mouseClicked() or mousePressed() functions to measure user input. Creating buttons requires testing the position of the mouse compared to the boundary of the button shape. This is shown in the examples utilizing mouseX and mouseY information covered in Assignment Three.
  * _ellipseMode()_
  * _mouseClicked()_
  * _mousePressed()_
  * _mouseX_
  * _mouseY_  
* Add another button, rectangle or ellipse, that uses the keyPressed() function and is triggered by a specific key on the keyboard. This means the mouse should be within in the boundaries of the button shape AND the chosen key should be pressed (not the mouse) to activate the button.
  * _keyIsPressed()_  
* Include if (conditional) statements (use one of the following, twice in your sketch, at a minimum, in your sketch):
  * _if_
  * _if/else_  
* Incorporate the following design principles in your assignment:
  * _Color, choose a color scheme, work with a palette of colors (maximum of five)._  
   **_The Adobe Color site is a good tool for selecting a group of colors using different systems from color theory._**  
  * _Alignment, Proximity, Similarity of elements in your composition._  
   **_Use these three principles to group elements together in the visual space._**  
  * _Scale and Proportion._  
   **_Use this design principle to indicate a visual hierarchy. (what is emphasised)._**
 
 

## [Assignment 7](Lent%207.zip)
 ### Requirements:  
* Design a composition that is within the theme of either Halloween, Retro Games, or Nature.  
* Create a canvas that is 400 pixels wide by 400 high (at a minimum).  
* Create and assign values to an array.  
* Use the print function to determine the length of an array you created and assigned values to.  
* Create an array, then assign values to the array using a for loop.  
* Create motion using values from an array. Using a for loop, draw shapes that include the array value as one of the position values for the shape, creating motion.  
* Set a value in the array to the a current mouse position value.
